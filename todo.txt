error --11/07/2018:
    "Warning: Can't call setState (or forceUpdate) on an unmounted component.
    This is a no-op, but it indicates a memory leak in your application.
    To fix, cancel all subscriptions and asynchronous tasks in the componentWillUnmount method.
    in ProfileGithub (at Profile.js:48)
    in div (at Profile.js:32)"

    --solution was to put a ref="checkref" in the div and
      check for the ref with 'this.refs.checkref' before setState.
